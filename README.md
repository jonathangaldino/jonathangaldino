  <summary><b>:books: Me & books â€” the history</b></summary>
  âœ¨ <strong>I finished my first book!</strong> âœ¨
   <br>
    I never liked books. In college, it was painful to read a book and study.<br> I started reading in January, 2022, and my idea was to give to books another chance.
    Now, I want to make it a habit. I want to keep going. Books are fun and a powerful way to stay with the mind sharp. <br>

    This is what I've been reading:
   <ul>
      <li>:white_check_mark: Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin</li>
      <li>:white_check_mark: The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick</li>
      <li>:hourglass: Domain-Driven Design Distilled by Vernon Vaughn</li>
   </ul>
