# Jonathan Galdino â€” @jonathangaldino

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jonathan â€” a software engineer at Voltz Motors âš¡ working on improving the experience of the customer on the e-commerce. I've worked on projects that impacted the lives of thousand of people. I'm a huge PC games nerd, fan of the JDM cars culture, and apprentice investor.

## Core values
:green_apple: Beginner's mindset and curiosity.  
:dancers: Strong collaborative skills.  
:small_red_triangle_down: I dig deep. I don't like shallow knowledge  
:100: I'm intense. Go hard or go home.  

## Goals for 2022

For this year, I want to improve my abilities in terms of software design, and my communication skills. Everything on this section is aligned with my major goal: to be **financially free** :money_with_wings:

- [x] Fully read a book
- [ ] Improve my communication skills
- [ ] Improve my English proficiency
- [ ] Design and launch a tool to help beginner investors automatize their lives in some way

  <summary><b>:books: Me & books â€” the history</b></summary>
  âœ¨ <strong>I finished my first book!</strong> âœ¨
   <br>
    I never liked books. In college, it was painful to read a book and study.<br> I started reading in January, 2022, and my idea was to give to books another chance.
    Now, I want to make it a habit. I want to keep going. Books are fun and a powerful way to stay with the mind sharp. <br>
    <br>    
    This is what I've been reading:
   <ul>
      <li>:white_check_mark: Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin</li>
      <li>:white_check_mark: The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick</li>
      <li>:hourglass: Domain-Driven Design Distilled by Vernon Vaughn</li>
   </ul>

## :hammer: Tech

I'm always in touch with several programming language, technologies, tools and libraries. 
Here's a few of them I've been working with on daily basis.

- Ruby / Ruby on Rails / RSpec
- Heroku / AWS
- Docker / Terraform / DevOps
- Postgres / Redis 

But I also like to use these whenever I have the chance.

- Node.js / React.js
- Typescript
- React Native / Flutter
