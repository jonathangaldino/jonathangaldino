## About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jonathan â€”  a senior software engineer from :brazil: âš¡ with more than 8 years of experience in web-development. 

I consider myself always an apprentice. I aim to teach you whatever I know and I also want to learn from you.
I'm usually that guy that learns how to do everything because I'm super curious.

I have a Bacherlor's degree in Computer Science from the Universidade TecnolÃ³gica Federal do ParanÃ¡ (UTFPR) â€” Santa Helena.
That's where my software engineering life begun.

## From the beggining
2016: I started researching IoT in college. I was motivated with the mix of hardware and software working together.
> I also had an amazing teacher back then - Dr. Itamar Iliuk! Shes' out of this world. She changed my life for good.

Started prototyping with Arduino, Raspberry Py, doing some Python with C++ (for embedded devices).
When I met NodeRED - amazing piece of software btw - that's when I started "integrating" and creating workflows (yeah, n8n is just a nodeRED with AI).
Started doing backend to enable communications from multiple tiny devices.
Learned React Native. Created an app to run backoffice stuffs in the platform.
Learned ReactJS to bring this backoffice to the lab's computer.
Awesome. 

From there, I invested some years into creating and publishing Apps with React Native.
But I really loved to work with Backend. So, since 2018, I've been working as a Software Engineer (with focus on Backend engineering).

That's it.


## Skils
:green_apple: Beginner's mindset and curiosity.  
:dancers: Strong collaborative skills.  
:small_red_triangle_down: I dig deep. I don't like shallow knowledge.  
:100: I'm intense. Go hard or go home.  

## Languages & Tools

I've been working with:

- React (Next.js, Vercel, for side projects I usually go with React Router 7/Remix)
- React Native (A bit of Expo, RN New Architecture,  Unistyles/Nativewind, A bit of Turbomodules, and other fancy packages OSS)
- Typescript, Node.js, Fastify, NestJS, a bit of Pulumi/Terraform for IaaS
- Cloud: I have experience with AWS and Google Cloud, mostly for serverless and event driven apps. I do like to use Cloudflare Workers, Workers KV, D1 and R2.
