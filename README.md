## About me


ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jonathan â€”  a senior software engineer from :brazil: âš¡ with more than 5 years of experience in web-development. 

I consider myself always an apprentice. I aim to teach you whatever I know and I also want to learn from you.
Together with my problem-solver skills, I want to contribute to the development of the product before even thinking about coding. **The devil is in the details, right?**

With a broad experience, working on different projects with a variety of technologies, I like to think I'm flexible enought to adapt, and I can be a fit for a diverse team without a problem.

I have a Bacherlor's degree in Computer Science from the Universidade TecnolÃ³gica Federal do ParanÃ¡ (UTFPR) â€” Santa Helena campus.

## Soft Skills
:green_apple: Beginner's mindset and curiosity.  
:dancers: Strong collaborative skills.  
:small_red_triangle_down: I dig deep. I don't like shallow knowledge  
:100: I'm intense. Go hard or go home.  

## :hammer: Hard Skills (a.k.a techs)
