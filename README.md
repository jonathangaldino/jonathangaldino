# Jonathan Galdino â€” @jonathangaldino

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jonathan â€” a software engineer at Voltz Motors âš¡ working on improving the experience of the customer on the e-commerce. I've worked on projects that impacted the lives of thousand of people. I'm a huge PC games nerd, fan of the JDM cars culture, and apprentice investor.

## Core values
:green_apple: Beginner's mindset and curiosity.  
:dancers: Strong collaborative skills.  
:small_red_triangle_down: I dig deep. I don't like shallow knowledge  
:100: I'm intense. Go hard or go home.  

## Goals for 2022

For this year, I want to improve my abilities in terms of software design, and my communication skills. Everything on this section is aligned with my major goal: to be **financially free** :money_with_wings:

- [x] Fully read a book
- [-] Improve my communication skills
- [-] Improve my English proficiency
- [ ] Design and launch a tool to help beginner investors automatize their lives in some way

### Looking back to 2022

I think improving my communication and english proficiency are both fluid goals. This means, they are not easily measurable, so I will put them in the corner and work on them through the years.
However, I failed on my last goal. Truth be told, I don't have any clue on how to do this.

## Goals for 2023

Work in progress.


## :hammer: Techs

I'm always in touch with several programming language, technologies, tools and libraries. 
Here's a few of them I've been working with on daily basis.

- Ruby / Ruby on Rails / RSpec
- Heroku / AWS
- Docker / Terraform / DevOps
- Postgres / Redis 

But I also like to use these whenever I have the chance.

- Node.js / React.js
- Typescript
- React Native / Flutter
- Golang
